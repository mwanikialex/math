Math Quiz solutions 

1.  

	Calculate the values inside the parentheses first:
(12 - 11) = 1
(5 + 6) = 11

	Now, calculate the product of (5 + 6) and (-3):
11 * (-3) = -33
	Calculate the product of (6 + 4) and 10:
(6 + 4)* 10 = 10 * 10 
= 100
	Finally, divide the result from step 2 by the result from step 3:
	(-33) / 100 = -0.33
   -0.33.


 2.  For the set of scores (Xi) of 17, 6, -12, 8 evaluate the expression    
To evaluate the expression Σ(xi), you need to sum up all the individual scores (xi) given:
x_i  = 17 + 6 - 12 + 8
x_i=19


 
3. Just give the answer from your calculator        
   The square root of 450 is approximately 21.21 (rounded to two decimal places).        
 4. Just give the answer from your calculator  
The square of -3.15, denoted as   9.9225.

5.   =
	First, calculate the square root of (0.5 * (1 - 0.5)):
√((0.5)(1-0.5) )/614  = √(0.5 * 0.5)= √0.25=0.5/24.77
	Now, multiply 1.65 by the result from step 1:
1.65 * 0.02 = 0.033
	Next, add 0.52 to the result from step 2:
0.52 + 0.033 = 0.553
So, the answer to the expression  is approximately 0.553




   6.    

First, evaluate the square root: √1426-1 = √1425
 = 37.7
Next,  36.17/37.7  = 0.958
Multiply that by 196: 196 * 0.958 = 187.77
Subtract that from 39.22: 39.22 - 187.77 = -148.55
So the final answer for    -148.55

   7. Find a, if     =
X=4.18
Z=1.96
S= 3.64
N=393

To find the value of 'a' using the given values of x, z, s, and n in the equation:
 
Let's substitute the values:
a = 4.19 ± 1.96 *  3.64/(√393-1)  

√393 ≈ 19.82 (rounded to two decimal places)
Now, subtract 1 from √393:
√393 - 1 ≈ 19.82 - 1 ≈ 18.82 
Now, calculate (3.64 / 18.82):
3.64 / (18.82)   ≈ 0.1932 
1.96 * 0.1932 ≈ 0.3788
a = 4.19 + 0.3788 ≈ 4.5688 
a = 4.19 - 0.3788 ≈ 3.8112 
So, for the given values of x, z, s, and n, there are two possible values for 'a':
For the addition case: a ≈ 4.5688
For the subtraction case: a ≈ 3.8112




8. Solve the equation for a, if   = 
Ps =	0.74
N =	414
P u =	0.5
Z =	1.65
p_u (1-p_u )= 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)
= 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
  = √(0.25/414)
Now, calculate this value:
√(0.25/414)  ≈ 0.0246
 Now, multiply z by this value:
1.65 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0405 
a = 0.74 + 0.0405  ≈ 0.7605
 a = 0.74 - 0.0405 ≈ 0.6995
So, for the given values of ps, n, pu, and z, there are two possible values for 'a':
	For the addition case: a ≈ 0.7605
	For the subtraction case: a ≈ 0.6995
